Each semester there is a latex fair held by the Bio 350 class which promotes students to seek safe, consensual sex, when they do. The students of the class then form groups to create a project in order to help educate others as to what safe consensual sex entails. The projects are turned in at the fair and presented to the teacher and the various teaching assistants to be judged. Once all of the projects have been submitted, a winning project is chosen, which for fall 2018 was my partner and I's project.

For this project I performed all of the programming in eclipse and used art created by my partner. You play the game by choosing which genital you wish to play as and then must dodge various stds, which look like germs, while trying to acquire a condom and consent before running into another gential. Depending on what you do or don't acquire before you come into contact with another genital determines what happens. For instance, not acquiring a condom beforehand might cause you to get an std.

Our project won that year's latex fair. The teachers, TAs and other students found it to be a novelty as no other students in the past had created such a project for the fair before. Usually the projects consist of posters, games such as throwing a dildo into the proper hole like cornhole, or other hands on things.
