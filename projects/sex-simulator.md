summary: A classmate and I created a short, educational videogame for our Bio 350 class.

Each semester at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, a latex fair is held by the Bio 350: Sex Differences in the life cycle class which promotes students to seek safe, consensual sex. The students of the class then form groups to create a project in order to help educate others as to what safe consensual sex entails. The projects are turned in at the fair and presented to the teacher and the various teaching assistants to be judged. Once all of the projects have been submitted, a winning project is chosen, which for fall 2018 was my partner and I's project.

During the fall semester of 2018 I happened to be taking my first programming class ever. At the time I had just learned about loops, if statements, etc. You know, all the basics of any programming language. The Bio project was just assigned right after I finished the second project of my programming class and I had gotten an itch for creating little games. Usually the projects for the fair consist of posters, games such as throwing a dildo into the proper hole like cornhole, or other hands on things. Between wanting to do something with my new knowledge and not wanting to have to go out to the store to purcahse supplies I decided on creating a short videogame.

For this project I performed all of the programming in eclipse using Java, with the help of [EZ Graphics](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/) and used art created by my Bio partner. You play the game by choosing which genital you wish to play as and then must dodge various stds while trying to acquire a condom and consent before running into another gential. Depending on what you do or don't acquire before you come into contact with another genital determines what happens. For instance, not acquiring a condom beforehand might cause you to get an std.

Our project won that year's latex fair. The teachers, TAs and other students found it to be a novelty as no other students in the past had created such a project for the fair before.

This project opened my eyes to how programming could be used in many fields in different ways. I knew at the time that I didn't make my game that complicated or use many if any data structures but it got me excited to learn more in order to create more sophisticated programs for a plethora of purposes.

You can view the code for this project on my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ryanell/projects/tree/master/Latexgame).
