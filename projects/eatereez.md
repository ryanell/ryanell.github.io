## A Better Way to Eat

UH Manoa has a plethora of choices when it comes to satisfying hunger; almost too many to keep track of for any one
 student. Eatereez provides a simple and streamlined way to discover previously unknown eateries located around campus. 
 
 The application's homepage can be accessed [here](https://nutrition-positions.github.io/)
 
 The source code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/nutrition-positions/eatereez)

## Eater-Easy To Use
 
 The website lets users get right into finding information on the landing page by presenting them with a search bar
  at the start. From there they can look for the exact eatery they want by name, or if their search results in
   nothing, they can change the search query and look further by using the filters provided on the list of
    eateries page.

  By clicking on the name of an eatery, or the "more info" link included in the information shown, the user will be
   taken to a details page that provides a complete description of the eatery along with a menu and reviews of that
    eatery written by fellow UH Manoa students, faculty and staff.

 are also able to delete the reviews that they write in case they make a mistake while writing their review.

## Developing More Than Just the App

Throughout working on this project, I developed greatly as a software developer, team member, leader, and teacher. I
 had a big hand in both the front end and back end development of the project. Creating the layout of the various
  pages and the structure of the database that we used in order to best store and retrieve information about the
   restaurants.
    
I created most of the admin side of the application, including the interface which allows admins to
    add and edit eateries, evaluate and remove reports and the relevant reviews from the site, evaluate user
     submitted eateries and all of the relevant databases for those actions. For the users, I created the navigation bar at the top, along with the footer that's displayed on the bottom  of
      each page.
