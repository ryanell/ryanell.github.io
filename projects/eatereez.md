## A Better Way to Eat

UH Manoa has a plethora of choices when it comes to satisfying hunger; almost too many to keep track of for any one
 student. Eatereez provides a simple and streamlined way to discover previously unknown eateries located around campus. 
 
 The application's homepage can be accessed [here](https://nutrition-positions.github.io/)
 
 The source code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/nutrition-positions/eatereez)

## Eater-Easy To Use
 
 The website lets users get right into finding information on the landing page by presenting them with a search bar
  at the start. From there they can look for the exact eatery they want by name, or if their search results in
   nothing, they can change the search query and look further by using the filters provided on the list of
    eateries page.

  By clicking on the name of an eatery, or the "more info" link included in the information shown, the user will be
   taken to a details page that provides a complete description of the eatery along with a menu and reviews of that
    eatery written by fellow UH Manoa students, faculty and staff.

Once logged in, users can write and report reviews, as well as submit possible new eateries. Users
 are also able to delete the reviews that they write in case they make a mistake while writing their review.
 
### Admin Management
 
Site admins are able to add, edit and remove eateries as well as reported reviews and can see the user submitted
 eateries in order to include them in the user accessible database.
 
### Something Special

On the landing page of the application, three random eateries are displayed which allow the user to
 discover an
 eatery which they might not previously have known existed.

## Developing More Than Just the App

Throughout working on this project, I developed greatly as a software developer, team member, leader, and teacher. I
 had a big hand in both the front end and back end development of the project. I implemented the layout of the various
  pages as well as some of the database that we used in order to store and retrieve information about the
   eateries. I created most of the admin side of the application, along with 
    
 including the interface which allows admins to
    add and edit eateries, evaluate and remove reports and the relevant reviews, evaluate user
     submitted eateries and all of the relevant databases for those actions. For the users, I created the navigation bar at the top, along with the footer that's displayed on the bottom  of
      each page and implemented the details page which reads out the relevant information store in the database.
