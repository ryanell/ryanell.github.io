## A Better Way to Eat

UH Manoa has a plethora of choices when it comes to satisfying hunger; almost too many to keep track of for any one
 student. Eatereez provides a simple and streamlined way to discover previously unknown eateries located around
  campus. 
 
 The application's homepage can be accessed [here](https://nutrition-positions.github.io/)
 The source code can be found on [The Github Organization Page](https://github.com/nutrition-positions/eatereez)
