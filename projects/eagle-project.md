From a young age I began as a scout. I joined Cub Scouts in first grade, after already having had attended many of my older brother's meetings and worked my way up to earn the arrow of light award then joined boy scouts. Over the years I learned many skills from the other boys in the troop and eventually learned to teach those skills to the younger scouts that joined over time. As I approached the age of 18, I became close to earning the rank of eagle, and in order to fulfill the requirements for the rank I had to organize and complete a project that gives back to the community which had helped me grow into the young scout I had become.

For my project, I organized the refurbishing of various shelves and cubbies for the elementary school at which our troop meets every week. I planned everything from purchasing or borrowing materials, scheduling the date and time in advance, acquiring food for the volunteers for lunch and more. During the project I helped manage the different stages of the project to keep things moving along as well as making sure those who knew how to sand and paint helped those who needed guidance, such as the younger scouts.
