# Overview
## Problem:
People don’t know where there is free parking close to campus. The Zone 20 parking structure fills up too early for some students, or they do not want to purchase day passes, permits, or carpool passes.

## Solution:
The Parking my Car app will allow users to mark where they can park their car and comment the times when they can normally find parking. Users can also put about how long it takes them to get to campus, if they need to walk, catch the Manoa Shuttle, or theBus.

# Mockup Page Ideas
* Landing Page
* Parking Page
* Admin Page
* User Page

# Case Ideas
- User goes to landing page which contains a map with pins for different parking areas
- User clicks on an area where they parked to mark it, then fill out the information (Times to park and how to get to campus)
- User clicks on a a pin to see the information on a location
- Admins can edit/remove parking locations based on users feedback

# Beyond the Basics
- Google Maps api
