## Tools Of The Trade

Software engineering is complicated. In order to create excellent software you need to build
 up an understanding of the various parts that compose it and the tools that you'll need to shape those parts to
  work most efficently together.

### A Seamless Blueprint

Just like constructing a building, engineering software requires a solid blueprint that depicts all of the
 features of your software. Planning
 out what your finished product will be is the most important step in creating something, similar to how you need a good
  foundation before you can build a building. Issue Driven Project Management is a part of Agile Project Management
   that can help increase the productivity of a team by leaps and bounds if used effectively. Issue Driven Project Management works by dividing up
    the different group members tasks in a way that lets them be completed in tandem. It sounds easy, but I've
     discovered that it actually takes a decent amount of experience to implement properly. 
      
Personally, I used to find it very enticing to jump right into a project and start working instead of taking the
 time to sit down and plan out each of the parts of the project. I had recently experienced working on a web
  application using this Issue Driven Project Management and at first we didn't do a great job of planning out what
   features we wanted in
   our project. We all just breifely went over what basic features we each wanted and then started on our way. As a
   result, my team members and I ended up having to re-write a lot of code because we were working on the same part
    of the project at the same time, or creating different features that clashed with each other. After realizing our
     project was full of mistakes, we sat
     down and wrote out which features each part of our sofware needed implemented that could be done at the same
      time. Doing so allowed each group member to work at the same time and drastically reduced the time it took to finish the project. 
      
This method of project management is something that I will be able to use in all types of software engineer projects, as well as in other fields of work. Being able to break down difficult tasks into smaller pieces allows for faster
 and more efficent work to be done as well as for multiple parts to be done at the same time (if multiple people are
  working together). It's an important skill
  for any member of a team working on a project. Whether it's used for creating an application, researching a new
   technology or many other projects, it's a skill that will make completing any task much easier.
   
### Rigorous Stress Testing

Even once a building or a structure is built, regardless of how well planned out, it has to undergo tests to make sure
 that it can
 fulfill it's job and
 not crack under pressure.
