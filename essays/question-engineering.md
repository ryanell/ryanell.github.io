Time is money, people won't spend their time sifting through the word puke that is your problem just to find out what the problem is. The kind of people who do software engineering and are good enough at it that they can answer the problems of others, don't want to waste their time. That means that you need to be short, sweet, to the point and polite when asking others for help. Unfortunately when people reach the point of frustration where they go to seek help, they sometimes have a hard time staying logical and not getting emotional.


The main job of a software engineer is to problem solve. Regardless of what language a software engineer programs in, you need to be able to deal with bugs when they pop up and with complicated systems that requires a solution, or implimentation, to be created. Typically your problems can be solved on your own, with either some short debugging or simply by rereading code, but there are times when you just come to the end of your patience and simply get stumped. That's when you start asking for help from others! Unfortunatly, asking for help from other software developers poses new problems on it's own. Usually being a software developer means you're busy, and if you're looking for help from another software developer it usually means that they're taking time out of their busy day to stop and help you out.


## Remember to Give your Questions A K.I.S.S.
