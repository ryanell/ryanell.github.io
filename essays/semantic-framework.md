##A Good Frame Means Less Work

A good way to think about what a framework is, at least from my experience of the Semantic UI framework, is like organizing photos. I've had to take a lot of photos for personal, school and buisness related activites and I've always had a hard time organzing them. Unfortunatly, I bad at it and I would always end up with a mess of photos all over the place, unorganized and taking up space on my hard drive in numerous places. It was a huge hassle and I always struggled in creating a simple method for organizing photos which I could later remember and then actually follow through with. As a result, reapeatedly made new and clever photo storage methods over and over and resulted in getting frustrated a lot. A framework would be similar to a well made method of organizing photos that can easily be changed to accomodate having photos for multiple purposes mixed together, or accomodate videos or more. In this case it could be compared to iPhoto or photo library. It lets you make albums and share them with others easily instead of attempting to do so by simply creating folders in the basic file systems.

## It's Easier to Follow Standards Than Create Your Own

As with organizing photos, I would always have a hard time using a method of organization that I tried to think up but realized its super convienent to simply use a program created for that purpose. It helped reduce the amount of work I needed to do and increased the speed at which I could find photos too!

In programming, a framework provides a base for you to stand on. It lets you spend your time working on your project instead of trying to create an organized and simple way to perform the specific task you wish to accomplish. Semantic UI essentially provides a lot of basic tools which otherwise would need to be recreated for each project from the ground up. It even has each of its aspects listed online in a rather easy to understand format with examples showing how much easier it is than doing things without it. The only drawbacks are that you have to learn how to use it and since there are more than just a couple, the one you like best and the one that works best might not be the same framework. Granted, usually the one that is the most popular is most popular for a reason.
