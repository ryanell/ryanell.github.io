I started learning javascript for my ICS 311 class on freecodecamp, a website which provides lessons in programming for free. I found the first half of each of the topics to be review and quite similar to my experience of writing java. Soon after each topic was introduced, however, my prior knowledge of java began to run out. The syntax of javascript is very similar to java but it's like someone took a shotgun and blew a bunch of holes into it. Sure that means you don't have to type as much and can do lots of neat things to help reduce the number of lines of code you write, but to me, that just made things more complicated at the time.

The majority of my experience programming has been in java from two computer science classes I've taken in the last year. With java, there's a lot of specification of things like variables, which require type declarations and lots of structure for how things get written. All which is kept track of by the computer and IDE. With javascript, from what I can tell, keeping track of what variable contains what kind of object is now something for the programmer (me) to keep track of. My background is that of mathematics, where keeping track of what kind of object each symbol in an equation represents is extremely important. It wasn't until during class the other day when I heard the professor say "There are no types in javascript, whether thats a bug or a feature, you decide". After an journey of ever decreasing fun through freecodecamp, that saying made me realize just how much I had been reling on syntax to do my work for me. It also made me realize that I had initally took the lack of typing as a "bug" and not a "feature". 

Many people have said doing something every day is a great way to get better at it. I think that's great advice and was initally rather prepared for the first Work Out of the Day (WOD). I had attended the bWOD beforehand and did rather well at the two example WOD assignments earlier in the week so I figured this first one would be cake. Unfortunatley I still wasn't familiar enough with javascript and made a small error, preventing me from finishing within the timeframe. That failure put a bit of a damper on my day but just made me all the more determined. I might have not done well on this WOD, I think the stress of needing to complete the assignment quickly caused me some difficulty in keeping a clear head, but I know I'll do better in the future. I won't let javascript convince me that it's riddled with bugs, instead I'll use those bugs to the best that I can.
