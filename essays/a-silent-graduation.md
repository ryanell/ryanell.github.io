Today was the day! I think? 

After four years of hard work (and some fun here and there), I earned a B.S. in Mathematics with a focus on Data Science. 

// family helped celebrate but graduation happened without a bang. It didn't feel like anything was different or that anything was finished. Sure no more having to attend video lectures and work on It wasn't an end to anything. The classes I took were just a (rather in depth) start to turn me towards the knowledge thats out there. Graduating in the field of maths and computer/data science is just a start to learning and getting hands on with all the technologies that are out there. 

// It's a fresh start to being creator, something that is easy to put on the backburner but will be left there no longer.
