Do you remember that question? That really important one that all the adults stressed when you were a little kid? Where they would sit you down and have you write down your answer to display in the classroom?

## Starting at the "top"

I remember that question. It stands out distinctly to me because for as long as I can remember I've never had an answer to it. I never really put much thought into the future. When I finished high school I came to college because that seemed like what a lot of people were doing and I didn't know what else to do. At the time of my high school graduation, I had really enjoyed my AP calculus class so I started a degree in Mathematics. I figured if I were to be learning something, I might as well be learning the most fundamental things in the universe, right?

After a while thought I realized that I didn't want to spend my time doing just pure mathematics my whole life so I considered just going "down the totempole" would be a decent way to figure out what I enjoy. 

On my way down I came across something I didn't know existed, someplace between maths and physics in my opinion. Computer science! I found it to be the perfect mix of getting to see mathematics in action while also being able to create things at the comfort of a desk.

## Developing A Kit

Since adding the data science focus to my degree, I've started building up a toolkit, similar to the one I had for mathematics. So far it's been just as much a chore to build my computer science toolkit as it was to build my mathematics one. A lot of learning the skills required to program and develop software 

## What The Future Holds

It might be that looking into a crystal ball won't show you much of my future besides a sea of fog, but I know that I won't stop learning and developing my skills in software engineering, development and lots of other fields.
